linker
======

This is a small python script that enables anyone to see a list of links from a webpage. The code was put together with Python and you will need Beautiful Soup 4 to get it to run. This is the first version of this script and it is very simple. I plan on working on it a bit more so that it runs smoothly and the links will be easier to read.
